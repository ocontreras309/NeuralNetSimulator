# Neural Network Simulator

Hello world

The aim of this project is to offer students an educational aid to learn about Machine Learning algorithms.

At this point, decision trees for classification are implemented. It is possible to test different datasets, as well as navigate through all steps in the tree generation process. I look forward to implement linear regression and neural networks later.

This project is open to contributions. To run the application, you should have a recent version of NodeJS, and then run the following commands:

```npm install```

```npm start```

Enjoy!
