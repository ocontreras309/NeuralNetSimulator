# Neural Network Simulator

The aim of this project is to offer students an educational aid to learn about Machine Learning algorithms.

At this point, decision trees for classification and regression are implemented. It is possible to test different datasets, as well as navigate through all steps in the tree generation process. I look forward to implementing linear regression and neural networks later.

This project is open to contributions. To run the application, you should have a recent version of NodeJS, and then run the following commands:

```npm install```

```npm start```

Special thanks to my students at Univalle, who contributed with interesting improvements and suggestions:
